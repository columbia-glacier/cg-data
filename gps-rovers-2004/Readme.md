Section A3.2.1: GPS

> A semi-permanent GPS station was installed on the surface of Columbia Glacier during June 2004 and operated for 60 days until mid-August 2004. A stable platform for this station was found ~7 km upstream from the terminus. The antenna was coupled to the surface using three ~10 m poles drilled into the ice in the shape of a triangle with a wooden platform near the top to stabilize the mount. The Trimble 4000 receiver, battery and charging system were tethered to a separate nearby pole. Position solutions were made 8 times daily and post-processed against a base station located near the terminus, providing ~2 cm positional precision.

## TODO

- Adjust times – suspected to be in MDT – to UTC.
- Convert single time column to time range.
- (optional) Convert GPS time to UTC (see https://r-how.com/packages/solidearthtide/UTCtoGPSTimeConversion, https://confluence.qps.nl/display/KBE/UTC+to+GPS+Time+Correction#UTCtoGPSTimeCorrection-UTCtoGPSTimeConversionTable).
