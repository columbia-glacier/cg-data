  "description": "A semi-permanent GPS station was installed on the surface of Columbia Glacier and operated from mid-June to mid-August 2004. A stable platform for this station was found ~7 km upstream from the terminus. The antenna was coupled to the surface using three ~10 m poles drilled into the ice in the shape of a triangle with a wooden platform near the top to stabilize the mount. The Trimble 4000 receiver, battery and charging system were tethered to a separate nearby pole. Position solutions were made every 6 to 3 hours and post-processed against a base station located near the terminus, providing ~2 cm positional precision (O'Neel, 2006, Section A3.2.1).",
