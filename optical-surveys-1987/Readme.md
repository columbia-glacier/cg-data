Observational Program

> Columbia Glacier was studied during the period July 5 to August 31, 1987 (J.D. 186 to 243); all dates are given in Julian days (J.D.). Frequent observations of glacier motion
were made at five points on the glacier surface over the longitudinal interval from km 52 to 59 (Figure 2). [...] Weather permitting, these observations could detect fluctuations in motion on time scales of as short as an hour or less. Frequent observations of basal water pressure were made in boreholes at km 52 and km 59. Meteorological variables and ablation of the ice surface were recorded as measures of the input of water to the glacier, and water output at an accessible glacier outflow stream was estimated from stream gauge recordings.

Flow velocities (EDM)

> Distances to markers near km 52 and 59, at the borehole sites (see below), were measured from Kadin (Figure 2) every 10 min, weather permitting, using two electronic distance meters (EDM) connected to an automated control and data acquisition system. The motion of these two markers was almost directly toward (in the case of km 52) or away (in the case of km 59) from Kadin. Manual repointing of the EDMs was necessary several times a day. Distances were corrected for atmospheric temperature and pressure using data obtained at Kadin. Angles to the two markers were measured with a theodolite approximately every 2 hours, visibility permitting. After removal of a few wildly aberrant values, distance and angle data were converted to displacements in successive time intervals; the standard error per observation is estimated to be 9 mm. The displacement data were smoothed with a cubic spline function that provides the smallest possible mean squared acceleration, consistent with having a mean squared deviation from the observations less than or equal to that of the measuring system (9 mm). This function was then differentiated to obtain velocity. Several breaks in the record were caused by heavy fog or rain.

Flow velocities (theodolite)

> Angles to markers at approximately km 53, 54, and 55 were measured from Kadin with a theodolite approximately every 2 hours, visibility permitting. The markers were stakes drilled into the ice. Distances from Kadin were measured at the beginning and end of the observation period and before and after each time the stakes were redrilled. Because of melting or cracking of the seracs and the difficulty of finding a helicopter landing site, the stake at km 54 had to be relocated in midseason at a distance from its original position (see Figure 2). The standard error of a single observation due to surveying error is estimated at <0.1 m, but the actual error could well range up to 0.2 m due to the wobbling of stakes in their holes as melting progressed. Displacements were calculated assuming that the stakes moved in a smooth path through the points determined by both angle and distance measurements. Darkness, fog, and rain caused frequent breaks in this record. The record for the markers near km 52 and km 59 is better because the EDM was read more often and at night, and because the marker stakes could be tended and reanchored frequently owing to their proximity to the drill sites.

## To Do

- Scan EDM measurements (currently at INSTAAR).
- Ask Mark Fahnestock for data used in his thesis ([Fahnestock 1991](http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/2920/)).
- (as needed) Extract ice velocities (meier-others-1994, Figure 4).
- (as needed) Extract rainfall, wind speed, temperature, ablation rate, river discharge, lake filling rate, and water level (meier-others-1994, Figure 5).
- (as needed) Extract water level in boreholes (meier-others-1994, Figure 7).s
- (as needed) Process original data.
