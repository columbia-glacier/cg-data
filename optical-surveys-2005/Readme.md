Section A3.2.2: Optical Surveys

> Three survey targets were deployed during June, 2005 (Figure A3.1), within one km of the calving face using a helicopter. The maximum lifetime of the markers was limited to 15 days, before each succumbed to calving. Positions of the targets were obtained using a Leica total station robotic survey theodolite at nominal time separation of 20-30 minutes. At 1-2 km ranges observed, position accuracy is ~5 cm. Two targets were placed (fortuitously) on an identical flowline, such that along-flow strain rates are calculable over a 5 day period.

In addition, a fourth marker (2) was deployed in June 2005 and a fifth marker (5) was deployed in September 2005, but these lasted only 9 and 51 hours, respectively.
