  "description": "Three survey targets were deployed during June, 2005, within one km of the calving face using a helicopter. The maximum lifetime of the markers was limited to 15 days, before each succumbed to calving. Positions of the targets were obtained using a Leica total station robotic survey theodolite at nominal time separation of 20-30 minutes. At 1-2 km ranges observed, position accuracy is ~5 cm. Two targets were placed (fortuitously) on an identical flowline, such that along-flow strain rates are calculable over a 5 day period (O'Neel, 2006, Section A3.2.2).",
